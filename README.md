# Git-and-Github

## What is Git?

- Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows

## What is GitHub?

- GitHub, Inc. (/ˈɡɪthʌb/[a]) is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

## What is the difference  between the two?

- git is local on your computer and github is online and can be used to share your work publicly

## Benefits of version control

- is a tool that helps developers/ programmers tackle some everyday problems, such as: tracking changes in the code, help to maintain the code, and allow them to work on the same source code files without affecting each other’s workflow. we can use version control to trace the mistake and go back to the latest working version of the code.

## Main Git commands

- git init - will create a new repository and you can create it within a directory buy adding [project name]
- cd .. - will move you back a folder
- ls - - to check files 
- cd folder name - to access a specific folder 
- git status - to check the status of your repository
- git add . - to add your changes to the staging area
- git commit -m "add message about commit here" - to commit those change to the repository
- git remote orign - this will sync your git folder to github
- git reset hard #commit number - to roll back to that commit 

## What are branches? 
- they are pointers off the same commit/increment you are working, so different people can work on there own branch without effecting the code on the main branch 

## What is merging/git merge? 
- when you want to add you branch the the main branch you merge it using git merge 

What is a Pull request?

- Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
